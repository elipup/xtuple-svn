  <title>System Administration</title>
  <para>Before you can begin processing Time and Expense Sheets, you must
  first set up the system with Expense Items, create Employees, and configure
  appropriate User Permissions. These activities should be completed by a
  manager responsible for time and expenseâ€•or dedicated information technology
  professional. In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:</para>

    <title>Expense Item Setup</title>
    <para>In order to use items for Project expenses, you need to create or
    edit existing reference Items and map expense accounts to the General
    Ledger. To demonstrate how this is done, we will use examples taken from
    the xTuple demo database. To begin, follow the steps below:</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Follow this path: <guimenuitem>Products &gt; Item &gt;
        List...</guimenuitem></para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select an existing Reference item, or create a new Reference
        item. For this example, we'll select the MILEAGE item.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select the "Project" Tab.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The following screen will appear:</para>

      </screenshot></para>
    <note>
      <para>The Project tab is only available for Reference item types.</para>
    </note>
    <para>Once "Allow use as Expense Item on Projects" is checked, the Project
    tab provides the ability to select a specific Account OR Expense
    Category.</para>
    <note>
      <para>In order to track costs for a Project an account or category MUST
      be selected for the item.</para>
    </note>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>ACCOUNT</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Identify a General Ledger (G/L) Account to be used for
          expensing Purchasing Expenses to. This is an Expense Account. This
          Account will be used to create distributions when Vouchering expense
          lines. The account will be debited when the Voucher is
          posted.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>EXPENSE CATEGORY</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Identify an Expense Category to distribute Purchasing Expenses
          to. The Expense Category is used to define a set of General Ledger
          (G/L) Accounts related to an expense. This Account will be used to
          create distributions when Vouchering expense lines. The account will
          be debited when the Voucher is posted.</para>

    <title>Configuring Employees</title>
    <para>Configuring Employees in xTuple is a critical component to time and
    expense since time sheets are associated with Employee. Only users that
    are set up as an Employee and have the correct level of permissions will
    have the ability to track their time.</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>To get started go to <guilabel>System &gt; Employees &gt;

    <para>In order to create vouchers to compensate Employees for expenses
    performed according to time sheet, the Employee must be selected as a
    vendor. Click on Detail tab and click vendor box.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Configuring User Permissions</title>
    <para>xTuple ERP has the powerful ability to manage user permissions,
    enabling you to allow or disallow access to various functional areas of
    the system. For example, a clerk may enter time and expense, while a
    manager may have the ability to Approve entries.</para>
    <para>There are several options available to you when managing system
    users. You can either A) assign individual permissions to users B) create
    preconfigured groups of permissions and assign individuals to these groups
    or C) a combination of A and B.</para>
    <para>The following path will get you to the screen for maintaining system
    users: <guimenuitem>System &gt; Maintain Users</guimenuitem>.</para>
    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="images/tepermissions.png" />
      </imageobject>
      <caption>List Users</caption>
    </mediaobject>
    <para>In this scenario, let's say we have a new Employee whose permissions
    we want to review. To begin, follow these steps:</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Highlight the user whose permissions we want to review</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select the EDIT button (or double-click on the user)</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The following screen will appear:</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="images/tepermissions2.png" />
      </imageobject>
      <caption>User Privileges</caption>
    </mediaobject>
    <para>As you can see, the basic user information&mdash;such as name and
    email address&mdash;has already been entered. The user has the ability to
    enter their own time and expenses, which you can see under the "Granted
    Privileges" section. We can add or remove privileges (by module) simply by
    selecting a specific privilege, and then choosing either the ADD or REVOKE
    button.</para>
    <tip>
      <para>Use the ADD ALL and REVOKE ALL buttons to move all the privileges
      at once for the specified module</para>
    </tip>
    <para>The user role feature makes it easy to define logical sets of
    privileges defined according to standard job roles. The following path
    takes you to the screen for defining role privileges: <guimenuitem>System
    &gt; Maintain Roles</guimenuitem>. More information regarding Role setup,
    please consult the xTuple ERP <ulink
    url="http://www.xtuple.org/docs/reference-guide">Reference
    Guide</ulink>.</para>
    <tip>
      <para>Time and Expense entry is closely integrated with Projects and
      Tasks. Users that are granted privileges to Time and Expense entry
      should also be granted MaintainProjects and ViewProjects in the CRM
      module.</para>
