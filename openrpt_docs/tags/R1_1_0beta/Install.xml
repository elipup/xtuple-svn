  <title>OpenRPT Installation Instructions</title>

  <para>Before compiling OpenRPT you will need to have the 
  appropriate Qt libraries installed on your system. In addition, 
  OpenRPT currently supports the PostgreSQL database using Qt&apos;s 
  PostgreSQL driver. At this time, if you wish to use a different 
  driver you will have to compile the appropriate Qt drivers and make 
  any changes necessary to OpenRPT to support driver specific 
  code.</para>

  <para>To compile OpenRPT you can run the following:</para>

  <para>
