  <title id="i570955">Report Writer Basics</title>

  <para>This chapter is designed to orient you to some of the basic properties
  of the OpenMFG report writer—whether you’re running the version embedded
  within the OpenMFG ERP Suite, or the standalone OpenRPT application.</para>

  <sect1 id="i550316">
    <title>OpenMFG Report Writer</title>

    <para>To open the report writer embedded within the OpenMFG application,
    log in to an OpenMFG database using an OpenMFG client. From the Master
    Information section of the System Module, select the “Reports” option, as
    shown in the following screen:</para>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure></para>

    <para>After you select the “Reports” option, the report definitions master
    list will appear, as shown below. The report definitions master list
    serves as the starting point for working with OpenMFG reports.</para>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure></para>

    <para>The report definitions master list displays information on all
    existing OpenMFG reports, including report name, grade, and
    description.</para>

    <note>
      <title>Tip</title>

      <para>Standard OpenMFG report definitions are delivered with a grade of
      “0”. By default, the OpenMFG client runs the highest numbered grade. To
      ensure that you can always return to the baseline version of a report,
      save your report definitions with a grade higher than 0.</para>
    </note>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>OpenRPT</title>

    <para>To open the standalone OpenRPT application, locate the OpenRPT
    executable file on your system. Then run the file to open it and reach the
    application desktop. The OpenRPT application desktop is shown in the
    following screenshot:</para>

    <para><figure>
        <title>OpenRPT Application Desktop</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure></para>

    <para>The basic functionality of the standalone OpenRPT application is
    identical to the functionality of the embedded report writer. The main
    difference is that OpenRPT can connect to any target database, whereas the
    embedded report writer may only be used by OpenMFG users connected to an
    OpenMFG database.</para>

    <title>The Toolbar</title>

    <para>In this section, we will explore the various options found on the
    report writer’s toolbar. The toolbar options are the same regardless of
    whether you’re running the embedded OpenMFG report writer or OpenRPT. For
    now, we will focus only on the toolbar functionality. In subsequent
    chapters, we will explain how to modify existing reports and also how to
    create new reports.</para>

    <para>To see the toolbar using the OpenMFG report writer, we must first
    open a report definition. The term “report definition” refers to the files
    created by the report writer. Page layout, database queries, and so on are
    all parts of a report definition. For this exercise, we’ll open a new
    report by selecting the NEW button from the report definitions master
    list. The following screen will appear:</para>

      <para>All the functionality accessible using the toolbar buttons is also
      available from the drop-down menus.</para>
    </note>

    <para>For the remainder of this section, we will examine each of the
    buttons on the report writer toolbar. The following screenshot shows a
    close-up view of the toolbar:</para>

    <para>As we look at the functionality related to each toolbar button, we
    will be moving from left to right—beginning with the New File
    option.</para>

    <title>Managing Report Definitions</title>

    <para>Report definitions created using the report writer are saved in
    Extensible Markup Language (XML) format. This is a universal standard file
    format, which simplifies the process of file sharing. Report definitions
    may be loaded into the report writer from a database, saved locally as
    XML, transferred via email or other method, and then uploaded for use in a
    different database. In this section, we will describe how to manage report
    definitions—moving them from a database to a local drive and back to a
    database again.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Loading Reports from a Database</title>

      <para>For the purposes of this exercise, we will assume we are
      connecting to an OpenMFG Database, using the OpenMFG report writer.
      However, you would follow similar steps using the standalone OpenRPT
      application connected to a different database.</para>

      <para>To begin with, let’s load an existing report definition into the
      report writer from an OpenMFG Database. From the Master Information
      section of the System Module, select the “Reports” option. The master
      list of report definitions will appear, as shown below:</para>

      <para>We will be working with an OpenMFG report definition called
      “UsersMasterList.” This is a report which details information about
      OpenMFG user accounts. We can load the report definition into the report
      writer simply by opening it. To open the report definition, double-click
      on it—or highlight it and then select the EDIT button. The following
      screen will appear:</para>

      <para><figure>
          <title>Load Report Definition from Database</title>

          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure></para>

      <para>The “UsersMasterList” is now loaded into the report writer. Our
      next step will be to save the report definition to a local drive.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="i547117">
      <title>Saving to XML</title>

      <para>Now that we have loaded the “UsersMasterList” report definition
      into the report writer, let’s save it to our local drive in XML format.
      To do so, select the “Save As” option from the “File” drop-down menu.
      The following screen will appear:</para>

      <para id="i565231"><figure>
          <title>Save Report Definition to XML Format</title>

          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata fileref="images/C01_405_SaveAsXML.png" />
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure></para>

      <para>As you can see from <xref linkend="i565231" />, our operating
      system prompts us to name the file and also specify a storage location.
      We navigate to a directory where other report definitions are stored and
      then give the file the same name it had when it was stored in the
      database. We also add the “.xml” extension to the end of the file
      name.</para>

      <note>
        <title>Tip</title>

        <para>The names of report definition files are case-sensitive. To
        ensure accuracy, keep this in mind when sharing report definition
        files from one database to another.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Using an XML-compatible browser, we can now open the report
      definition and view the XML code, as shown in the following
      screenshot:</para>

      <para><figure>
          <title>Report Definition XML Rendered in a Browser</title>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure></para>

      <para>So, we have stored the report definition on our local drive in the
      portable XML format. We are now able to share the file with other users,
      load it into the report writer for editing, or save it to another
      database.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Loading from XML</title>

      <para>Before we can save a locally-stored report definition to another
      database, we must first load the XML file into the report writer. To
      load a locally-stored report definition into the report writer, select
      either the “Open File” button or the “Open” option from the “File”
      drop-down menu. The following screen will appear:</para>

      <para id="i565202"><figure>
          <title>Loading XML File into the Report Writer</title>

          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure></para>

      <para>As <xref linkend="i565202" /> shows, our operating system prompts
      us to locate the file we want to load into the report writer. Once we
      locate and select the file, the report writer loads it, as shown in the
      following screenshot:</para>

      <para><figure>
          <title>Report Definition Loaded from XML File</title>

          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure></para>

      <para>Now that the report definition has been loaded into the report
      writer, we can transfer it to a database—which we will do in our next
      step.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="i552942">
      <title>Saving to a Database</title>

      <para>Next we will save the XML report definition to an OpenMFG
      Database. With the report definition loaded into the report writer,
      select the “Save to DB” option from the “Database” drop-down menu, as
      shown below:</para>

      <para><figure>
          <title>Saving Report Definition to Database</title>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure></para>

      <para>Because in this example we are connected to an OpenMFG Database, a
      large number of report definitions are already stored on the database.
      The complete list of stored report definitions appears in the next
      screen, which appears after we select the “Save to DB” option from the
      “Database” drop-down menu:</para>

      <para><figure>
          <title>Save Report to Database with a Higher Grade</title>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure></para>

      <para>OpenMFG can only generate reports using report definitions which
      are saved to its database. To distinguish between different versions of
      a report definition, the report writer employs grades. By default,
      OpenMFG uses the report definition with the highest grade.</para>

      <note>
        <title>Tip</title>

        <para>Standard OpenMFG report definitions are delivered with a grade
        of “0”. By default, the OpenMFG client runs the highest numbered
        grade. To ensure that you can always return to the baseline version of
        a report, save your report definitions with a grade higher than
        0.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Because our OpenMFG Database already contains one version of the
      “UsersMasterList” report definition, let’s save our current version with
      a grade of 50. This will clearly mark our current version as the default
      version OpenMFG should use. To see the two versions with their different
      grades, open the “Load from DB” option from the “Database” drop-down
      menu. The following screen will appear:</para>

      <para><figure>
          <title>Note Multiple Grades for a Single Report</title>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure></para>

      <para>Keep in mind once again that OpenMFG will use the
      “UsersMasterList” report definition with grade 50 when executing this
      report.</para>

    <title>Parts of a Report Definition</title>

    <para>Report definitions are structured documents used to extract data
    from a database and then print that data on one or more pages. The report
    writer gives you the ability to define simple or complex structures. In
    this section, we will look at the parts of a report definition.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Section Editor</title>

      <para>Report definitions created using the report writer consist of
      three basic sections. Those three sections are as follows:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Headers: Headers are frequently used for titles, column
          headings, and key report information—such as Customer contact
          information on an Invoice. Headers may contain queries, but unlike
          the Detail sections of a report, Headers will only display the first
          row returned for a query.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Footers: Footers often contain summary data—such as
          totals.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Detail Sections: Detail sections typically contain the core
          information found in a report. Detail section information is
          typically represented in the form of multiple rows of values that
          were returned by a query.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>To add sections to or remove sections from a report definition,
      use the section editor. To access the section editor, open a report
      definition and select the “Section Editor” option from the “Document”
      drop-down menu. The following screen will appear:</para>

      <para id="i566833"><figure>
          <title>Section Editor</title>

        </figure></para>

      <para>As you can see in <xref linkend="i566833" />, the section editor
      contains controls for each of the three basic section types. In the
      following examples, we will discuss all the controls found on the
      section editor screen.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="i570960">
      <title>Report Headers</title>

      <para>Report Headers are commonly used to create report titles. Report
      Headers have the following characteristics:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Always print on the report</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>

          <para>Only print on the first page</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Only display the first row of data returned by a query</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>For the purposes of this exercise, we will assume we are working
      with a blank report definition having no sections currently defined. To
      add a Report Header to a report definition, select the “Report Header”
      option from the section editor screen. The Report Header section will be
      added to the report definition, as shown in the following screen:</para>

      <para id="i566952"><figure>
          <title>Report Header Section</title>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure></para>

      <para>When a section is added to a report definition, the name of the
      section appears in the upper-left-hand corner of the section. As you can
      see from <xref linkend="i566952" />, our newly-added section is clearly
      labeled “Report Header.”</para>

      <para>To remove a Report Header from a report definition, simply uncheck
      the “Report Header” option on the section editor screen.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="i571060">
      <title>Page Headers</title>

      <para>Page Headers are commonly used to contain column headings. Page
      Headers have the following characteristics:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Always print at the top of a page</para>
        </listitem>

        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>To accomodate the requirements of multi-page reports, the report
      writer supports the following five different types of Page
      Headers:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>First Page: Prints at the top of the first page of a
          report</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Even Page(s): Prints at the top of even pages of a
          report</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Any Page(s): May be used to print at the top of any page of a
          report</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Last Page: Prints at the top of the last page of a

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Odd Page(s): Prints at the top of odd pages of a report</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Again, only one Page Header may be printed per page. When a report
      definition contains more than one Page Header, the report writer
      recognizes the Page Headers in the following order of precedence: 1)
      First Page; 2) Last Page; 3) Even Page(s); 4) Odd Page(s); 5) Any
      Page(s).</para>

      <note>
        <title>Tip</title>

        <para>If your report definition includes both “Even Page” and “Odd
        Page” Page Headers, don’t include an “Any Page” Header. Based on the
        report writer’s precedence rules, the “Any Page” Header would never
        print in this scenario.</para>
      </note>

      <para>To add a Page Header to a report definition using the section
      editor, select the type of Page Header you want to add from the “Page
      Header” section of the screen. For this exercise, we will add a first
      Page Header, as shown in the following screen:</para>

      <para id="i567243"><figure>

        </figure></para>

      <para>As you can see in <xref linkend="i567243" />, the Page Header
      section is added above the Report Header section. If subsequent Page
      Header sections are added, they will also be placed above the Report
      Header section, but below the “First Page” Header.</para>

      <para>The core information in a report is displayed in its Detail
      section. Detail sections have the following characteristics:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Generally print in the middle of a page</para>
        </listitem>

        <para>The report writer allows you to incorporate an unlimited number
        of Detail sections into a report definition, although most contain
        just one.</para>
      </note>

      <para>The section editor handles Detail sections differently than it
      handles Header and Footer sections—that is, the process for adding and
      managing Detail sections is more involved. The following screen shows
      the section editor with a Detail section added:</para>

      <para>As you can see in <xref linkend="i569340" />, the Detail section

      <title>Group Sections</title>

      <para>While most reports can be defined using a single Detail section
      having multiple columns and rows of data, others require summary
      data—such as subtotals. For reports requiring summary data, the report
      writer supports Group sections. Group sections have the following
      characteristics:</para>

      <para>When a Group Header and Group Footer have been added using the
      section editor, the report writer incorporates both sections into the
      report definition, as shown in the following screen:</para>

      <para id="i570362"><figure>
          <title>Group Headers and Footers</title>

          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata fileref="images/C01_523_GroupHeadFoot.png" />
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure></para>

      <para>As you can see in <xref linkend="i570362" />, the Group Header has
      been added above the Detail section, and the Group Footer has been added
      below the Detail section.</para>

      <para>To better understand the relationship between Detail sections and
      Group Headers and Group Footers, let’s look at a sample report generated
      from data in an OpenMFG Database. The following Sales Analysis report is
      called “Time Phased Sales History by Customer by Item”:</para>

      <para id="i568052"><figure>
          <title>Sample Report Showing Group Headers and Group Footers</title>

          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata fileref="images/C01_520_GroupSectionsReportExample.png" />
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure></para>

      <para>The “Time-Phased Sales History by Customer by Item” report
      contains a Detail section with two Group sections associated with it.
      The outermost Group section refers to Customer information. The second,
      innermost Group section refers to Item information. Basically, if you
      study the report shown in <xref linkend="i568052" />, you will see that
      the sections are printed in the following descending order:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Group Header (Customers</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Group Header (Items</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Detail Section (Dates/Amounts)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Group Footer (Items)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Group Footer (Customers)</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>Because the report contains data for two Customers, you can see in
      the screenshot that the sequence of sections repeats itself twice. You
      can also see that Group Footers are used to provide both Item and
      Customer subtotals. As we mentioned earlier, Group sections are commonly
      used for summary information.</para>

      <note>
        <title>Note</title>

        <para>Group Headers and Group Footers are powerful features which
        enable you to generate reports which provide multiple levels of detail
        and roll-up values. However, you will find that most report
        definitions will conform to the following basic structure:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Page Header: Any Page(s)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Detail Section</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Page Footer: Any Page(s)</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </note>

      <para>The report shown in <xref linkend="i568052" /> is the actual
      report printed from data in an OpenMFG Database. The following
      screenshot shows the report definition used to generate the sample
      report.</para>

      <para id="i570712"><figure>

        </figure></para>

      <para>If some aspects of the report definition shown in <xref
      linkend="i570712" /> seem confusing, don’t worry. We will be covering
      the mechanics of report writing in subsequent chapters.</para>
