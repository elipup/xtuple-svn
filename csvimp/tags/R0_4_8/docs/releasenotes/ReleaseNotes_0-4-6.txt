Release Notes
xTuple CSV Import
Version 0.4.6
Oct 12, 2012
==================================

This is a release of xTuple's CSV Import tool (CSVImp) including
internal architectural changes, bug fixes, and new features.


New Features:

Support for tab-separated-value files. Actually, you can now specify
any separator character except double-quote ("). The separator is
also stored in the Atlas file as part of individual maps. File load
performance is much better and much larger files can be processed,
in part because the preview window does not automatically show all
rows from the file. [ 18328 ]
