    <title>Product Overview</title>
    <para>Congratulations! You are now the proud owner one of the most
    powerful open source enterprise tools available, the xTuple Point of Sales
    (POS) system. The most important value that xTuple promotes is helping
    your business grow. And xTuple POS is designed to do just that for your
    retail business.</para>
    <para>xTuple POS adds retail functionality on top of the foundation of
    xTuple ERP. This means that in addition to the xTuple POS retail features,
    you also have access to the full range of advanced ERP features—such as
    accounting, inventory management, and customer relationship management
    (CRM). xTuple POS is designed to allow you to track and process sales
    using a cash register system, providing your operation with historical and
    real time data from retail sales. However, the system is not limited to
    sales data. You can also collect data regarding inventory availability,
    returns, quotes, customer information, commissions and more. Having all
    this data available at your finger tips improves your ability to serve
    your customers!</para>
    <para>Here are just a few real world examples of how xTuple POS can help
    you:</para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Visibility Across Multiple Stores</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>If you need to track down an item for a customer because it's
          out of stock in Store A, you can use xTuple POS to learn if the same
          item is available at Store B.</para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Detailed Sales History</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>When customers have questions about recent purchases, you can
          quickly access sale and item information to provide excellent
          customer service. Using either a receipt number or basic customer
          information—such as phone number—you can answer any number of
          questions regarding date of sale, purchase price, discounts, item
          description, etc.</para>

        <term>Inventory Control</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Because you can track inventory and shopping patterns, the
          retailer's buying process is made much more effective. Visibility
          into slow moving inventory enables you to provide your customers
          with the products they want in a timely fashion—instead of spending
          endless hours speculating over what consumers may or may not
          purchase.</para>

    <title>Open Source Software: What is it and what does it mean to
    me?</title>
    <para>By now you may have heard some buzz about open source software—and
    you're not sure what to make of it. It may even sound like a bunch of
    technical jargon used to impress IT professionals, which may or may not
    apply to yourself. This is all the more reason why we want to provide you
    with a little insight into what open source software is and what it means
    to you.</para>
    <para>In a nutshell, open source software provides users with access to
    software source code. By source code, we mean the programming files that
    form the basis for a software product. Open source software is different
    from closed source software, in that closed source software locks up its
    source code and hides it from end users. Traditionally, closed source
    software has been the more common form of commercial "boxed" software
    products that you would pick up at your local office store. A result of
    the open source movement has been several licensing and distribution
    models:</para>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Community license</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Applications are free to anyone and developed as projects in
          large groups based on public input.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Dual license</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>A combination of free and commercial applications. A company
          may provide some software tools that are free to the public, while
          others are sold commercially.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Shared source license</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Commercial software where the source code may be viewed;
          however, there is no ability to make changes to the code.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <note>
      <para>xTuple software generally falls under the second category: "dual
      license." That's because we offer both free and commercial applications,
      with our source code available for review and change.</para>
    </note>
    <para>Still wondering what all this means to you? Well, what it means is
    that the software we've created has grown based on direct feedback from
    YOU our user community.</para>
    <para>At xTuple, we don't hide our work from public scrutiny. Rather, we
    present our work for all to see. We do this to promote shared insight into
    how we can continue to improve the software to make your job easier. In
    fact, on the xTuple community website we encourage you to provide direct
    feedback regarding bugs you've found or features you may find useful in
    the future. We also invite you to share your success stories and tips and
    tricks. In this way, you can reach out and help other xTuple community
    members.</para>
    <para>And, If you are an IT professional and a bit of a code jockey, you
    can even make changes to the source code on your local copy. Many of our
    greatest enhancements have been sponsored by our customers—and these
    changes have been rolled into the final product so that other users can
    benefit from the improvements. This means our tools and products are not
    designed solely by xTuple engineers. They are also designed by the people
    who use them everyday. We at xTuple encourage you to learn more about the
    community and get involved on the <ulink
    url="www.xtuple.org">xTuple.org</ulink> website. Rather than quietly
    grumbling to yourself about things you think could be better, reach out to
    fellow community members to find out how to make these changes
    happen!</para>

    <title>xTuple Application Architecture</title>
    <para>The xTuple applications are designed on a two-tier system:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Graphical client built using the open source Qt development
        framework</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Database server running on the open source PostgreSQL
        database</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>All of the xTuple business logic resides in the database, so there
    is no middle tier (i.e., Java/application server). And the client is
    "thin". Since Qt and the PostgreSQL database are cross-platform solutions,
    the application can be installed on Mac, Windows, or Linux machines—in any
    combination you prefer. There is also a wireless client which runs on a
    hand-held bar code scanner.</para>
    <para>Installation of xTuple is easy and painless. Once you download the
    software, you then run the xTuple graphical client out of the directory it
    resides in. The same xTuple client can connect to a database for any of
    the xTuple ERP editions: PostBooks, Standard, or Manufacturing. Upgrading
    from one edition to the next involves little more than running a
    two-minute script on your database. The simplicity of the upgrade process
    illustrates the point that xTuple maintains a single code base for all of
    its ERP editions. Doing so enables our community of open source users to
    share and work together in one online hub for all the xTuple
    products.</para>
    <para>There are several layers of security available with xTuple ERP. You
    can utilize a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection, and you can also
    enable an enhanced authentication mechanism which scrambles your users'
    passwords. In addition, you can also assign individual privileges with the
    system in as much detail as you see fit for your operation.</para>
